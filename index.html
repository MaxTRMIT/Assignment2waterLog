							   <br>
							   I was born in rural NSW and moved to Sydney when I was 18 years old. I am currently employed as a Coach and Administrative Officer at a Martial Arts Academy on Sydney’s North Shore. I graduated from South Grafton High School in 2013. I am currently enrolled in an IT degree at RMIT university and am studying via Open University. As well as work and education I compete in Muay Thai Kickboxing, Submission Grappling and Folkstyle Wrestling Competitions at both regional and state levels. 
							   
							   From making video games to website and app design, I have been tinkering with aspects of IT since my family got its 1st computer in 2004. Now as an adult I have started this degree to learn more about technology. The parts of Information Technology that interest me are mainly cyber security, application design and sharing Technology with the world. I am passionate about making the world a better place through the tools that Information Technology supplies us.

							   <h2 style="color:powderblue;">About Me</h2>   
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">RMIT Student Number: s3667801.</p.l>
								 <p.l style="font-family:courier;">My name is Imogen Leaver, I am Australian born, of English, Irish and Scottish decent.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I only speak English, however my sister-in-law is half Peruvian, and is determined to teach me Spanish.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I am currently completing a Bachelor of Business – Financial Planning, having gained recognition of prior learning from a Diploma in Business.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I love riding my bike, going to the beach, travelling (on hold thanks to COVID), my family and considering the environment.</p.l>
							   <br>
							   
								<h2 style="color:powderblue;">Interest in IT</h2>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">This IT unit is a core subject in my business degree, running two business, I completely appreciate why IT is essential to understanding and learning about business. It is the platform on which we communicate, manage eCommerce, accounting, taxation, and advertise and market our business.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I am currently in the process of creating an ecommerce website, it has shown me how ignorant I was about IT (and how fundamental it is to modern business). I am keen to learn more through this course, if not to sound less ignorant, to be more self-sufficient with managing this side of business.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I arrived at RMIT because it offered the specific degree I was after, my key interest is business, specifically the financial planning aspect (of life & business). Other universities offer similar commerce, accounting, finance, and business degrees, however not with the financial planning angle I was after.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I only have 6 subjects left to complete my degree, I have learnt so much thus far and expect to expand my knowledge of financial and accounting compliance, wealth creation and management, and of course IT!</p.l>
							   <br> 
								 <h2 style="color:powderblue;">IT Experience</h2>
							   
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I am currently completing a business degree, analysing business to improve efficiency and profitability is what I am passionate about.  To strategise and implement change in a local council, bettering the lives of the residents in that municipality (especially an area with lower socio-economic status) would be a passion job for me.</p.l> 
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I have worked in senior business roles for over a decade, I have experience managing teams, liaising with all levels of business support and management, improving business procedures and profitability and as mentioned above, I am currently in the last stages of completing a business degree (majoring in financially planning), which will solidify and streamline my business experience. I certainly could expand my knowledge in IT (which at present is reasonably basic), it is an area where I have previously relied on expert team members and departments to support me. I am hoping this unit in addition to further hands on experience, especially in the technical side of IT will improve my competency and eligibility for employment positions such as this.</p.l>

							   Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
   
							   Why do we use it?
							   It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
							   
							   
							   Where does it come from?
							   Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
							   
							   The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
							   
							   Where can I get some?
							   There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the

							<h1>Professional Interview</h1>
						  </div>
						  <div class="col-sm-12">
							<p>The interview that we conducted was with an IT professional that works with both a independent software contractor and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Below you will find a summary of the answers given by our Interviewed IT Professional. Due to contract issues we are unable to use the recording, but I have attached the transcript in the report attached.  

 

							  <h2>1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h2>

Most of my work is in the financial markets. Previously I worked in research roles using programming to research different concepts in the stock market. My current role is technically called product owner with a software development company that is replacing the ASX backend clearance and settlement system which is basically a big database.<br>

It's quite a well-known system it's called chess. The last time it was replaced was 30 years ago. We are using a Distributed ledger like a block chain solution. The company I work for has their own smart contracting language that pairs the buyers and the sellers together. The role that I'm in is product owner.<br>

This is that under the agile model of software development. Where you have short term targets and sprints in contrast to a waterfall model where you’ll be planning for months or even years. Because there is a big infrastructure, we must split everything into like 2-week intervals. My role is to communicate from the customer, The ASX, and our team of software engineers and testing for any problems that may come up under the ASX Security guidelines.<br>

<br><h2>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h2>

I’ve always been in financial markets. Previously as a big broker dealer for Charles Shaub. Most of my work is about financial markets. Either stocks or the backend plumbing of how it works. ITs great being multi-industry because I have so much room to work with. 

<br><h2>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h2>

In Previous roles I've done a lot of managerial stuff, current role is slightly different as instead of managing people our professional is a managing a product.  

A Large portion of work is writing tests to make sure that everything in the project is by ASX standards of development and security.  

<br><h2>4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</h2>
 

I'm the bridge between the IT guys and the finance guys so they’re is a big range of personality types that I've got to work with. 

<br><h2>5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h2>

Because of the nature of the project we have some of the best developers from around Australia for the languages that we are using. We have a lot of smart and quirky people. Overall, everyone is quite professional and nice on the IT side of things. Everyone on the ASX side is a little more integrated into suit culture but also still very nice people. As I must be the bridge between the finance guys and the IT guys it helps to be friends with them all to understand where they are coming from. 

<br><h2>6. What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h2>

There can be challenges with any client, especially such a bug project like this, there are times where we don’t agree on what should be done. In that case we must negotiate to get the client what they want while still doing it in a safe, efficient and sustainable way.  

<br><h2>7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h2> 

When I started it was learning how to communicate with my coworkers effectively and get like settled in but now the most time would be to write those tests that verify that we are doing the right thing, something that meets the requirements. A lot of it is managing the workload of others but currently in the project it's a lot of tests. 

<br><h2>8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h2>

I made a very big change to get into this role, as I hadn't done any of the background or plumbing stuff yet. I didn’t have much exposure to all the little transfers and terms that the ASX has for things. Smart contacts and the new test language were also a big struggle to learn. It took me about 6 months to feel like I was adding value to the team as there was just so much to understand when I started. 

<br><h2>9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h2>

I don’t know that seems like a vague one so I'll try put it as best as I can. Using the latest technology to improve technologies, to streamline and to make things easier and more efficient for everyone. </div>
