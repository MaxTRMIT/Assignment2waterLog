							   Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
   
   Why do we use it?
   It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
   
   
   Where does it come from?
   Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
   
   The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
   
   Where can I get some?
   There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the

							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">RMIT Student Number: s3667801.</p.l>
								 <p.l style="font-family:courier;">My name is Imogen Leaver, I am Australian born, of English, Irish and Scottish decent.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I only speak English, however my sister-in-law is half Peruvian, and is determined to teach me Spanish.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I am currently completing a Bachelor of Business – Financial Planning, having gained recognition of prior learning from a Diploma in Business.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I love riding my bike, going to the beach, travelling (on hold thanks to COVID), my family and considering the environment.</p.l>
							   <br>
							   
								<h2 style="color:powderblue;">Interest in IT</h2>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">This IT unit is a core subject in my business degree, running two business, I completely appreciate why IT is essential to understanding and learning about business. It is the platform on which we communicate, manage eCommerce, accounting, taxation, and advertise and market our business.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I am currently in the process of creating an ecommerce website, it has shown me how ignorant I was about IT (and how fundamental it is to modern business). I am keen to learn more through this course, if not to sound less ignorant, to be more self-sufficient with managing this side of business.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I arrived at RMIT because it offered the specific degree I was after, my key interest is business, specifically the financial planning aspect (of life & business). Other universities offer similar commerce, accounting, finance, and business degrees, however not with the financial planning angle.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I only have 6 subjects left to complete my degree, I have learnt so much thus far and expect to expand my knowledge of financial and accounting compliance, wealth creation and management, and of course IT!</p.l>
							   <br> 
								 <h2 style="color:powderblue;">IT Experience</h2>
							   
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I am currently completing a business degree, analysing business to improve efficiency and profitability is what I am passionate about.</p.l> 
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I have worked in senior business roles for over a decade, I have experience managing teams, liaising with all levels of business support and management, improving business procedures and profitability and as mentioned above, I am currently in the last stages of completing a business degree (majoring in financially planning), which will solidify and streamline my business experience. I certainly could expand my knowledge in IT (which at present is reasonably basic), it is an area where I have previously relied on expert team members and departments to support me. I am hoping this unit in addition to further hands on experience, especially in the technical side of IT will improve my competency and eligibility for employment positions such as this.</p.l>

All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the

						   <h2>What does it do?</h2>
						 <p.l>Cloud computing has been around for 20 years or so, it is an operational technology used for a plethora of purposes.</p>
						 <p.l>Clouds are communal resources (computers, applications, storage systems and services) where data is stored on another computer. Clouding computing is essentially outsourcing or centralising servers to facilitate access from anywhere and eliminating restrictions to a location, for example, a cloud host for a website allows everyone in the world to access the website from any device.</p>
						 <p.l>Cloud computing also offers additional security features and provides for automatic maintenance and updates, generated remotely, and uploaded to your devices upon authorisation.</p>
						   <h2>What can be done now?</h2>
						   <p.l>Today there are three main types of cloud computing, Public, Private and Hybrid:</p>
						   <p.l>Public clouds are owned and managed by a cloud provider, who delivers services to a customer via an online account. All hardware, software and infrastructure is managed by a third-party.</p>
						   <p.l>Private cloud services are wholly owned and utilised by an organisation, the hardware can either be located onsite or offsite (supplied by a third-party host). The services and infrastructure are managed on an exclusive network.</p>
						   <p.l>Hybrid clouds are a combination of both private and public clouds, where data and applications are pooled between both clouds. Its offers flexibility and utilises existing infrastructure, security, and compliance.</p>
						   <p.l>There are also three main types of cloud services:</p>
						   <p.l>Software as a Service, aka SaaS, is a service which delivers software applications over the internet. The software provider hosts, manages, and maintains the application and all underlying infrastructure. It is generally hired on a subscription basis and connected via an account over the internet.</p>
						   <p.l>Platform as a Service, aka PaaS, provides a platform for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. The user, usually a developer, pays for the hired use of the infrastructure, storage, network, and database to develop.</p>
						   <p.l>Infrastructure as a Service, aka IaaS, is as basic as cloud computing goes, you rent infrastructure (servers, virtual machines, storage, networks, operating systems) from the provider and pay on demand.</p>
						   <h2>What is likely to be done soon?</h2>
						   <p.l>In the next few years, almost all computing will be done via cloud. Cloud computing is built for automation, so can merge with legacy, current and new technologies to create an efficient, dynamic system.</p>
						   <p.l>A future focus on better cohesion with legacy systems will allow businesses with complex and ridged operating structures to transfer to a cloud-based operating system more easily.</p>
						   <p.l>Micro data centres are gaining traction, these compact units are located close to devices (which requires less bandwidth), where they perform certain tasks previously performed by large data centres.</p>
						   <p.l>Microsegmentation is an emerging software method used for data security, it creates an isolated ‘secure zone’ in a data centre, minimising the breadth and impact of a security breach.</p>
						   <p.l>With the increased need for data comes the increased need to deliver data faster, Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) is a storage protocol which accelerates the transfer of information between systems, drastically enhancing data relocation.</p>
