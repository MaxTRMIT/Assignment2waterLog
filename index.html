I was born in rural NSW and moved to Sydney when I was 18 years old. I am currently employed as a Coach and Administrative Officer at a Martial Arts Academy on Sydney’s North Shore. I graduated from South Grafton High School in 2013. I am currently enrolled in an IT degree at RMIT university and am studying via Open University. As well as work and education I compete in Muay Thai Kickboxing, Submission Grappling and Folkstyle Wrestling Competitions at both regional and state levels.
From making video games to website and app design, I have been tinkering with aspects of IT since my family got its 1st computer in 2004. Now as an adult I have started this degree to learn more about technology. The parts of Information Technology that interest me are mainly cyber security, application design and sharing Technology with the world. I am passionate about making the world a better place through the tools that Information Technology supplies us.

							   <h2 style="color:powderblue;">About Me</h2>   
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">RMIT Student Number: s3667801.</p.l>
								 <p.l style="font-family:courier;">My name is Imogen Leaver, I am Australian born, of English, Irish and Scottish decent.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I only speak English, however my sister-in-law is half Peruvian, and is determined to teach me Spanish.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I am currently completing a Bachelor of Business – Financial Planning, having gained recognition of prior learning from a Diploma in Business.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I love riding my bike, going to the beach, travelling (on hold thanks to COVID), my family and considering the environment.</p.l>
							   <br>
							   
								<h2 style="color:powderblue;">Interest in IT</h2>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">This IT unit is a core subject in my business degree, running two business, I completely appreciate why IT is essential to understanding and learning about business. It is the platform on which we communicate, manage eCommerce, accounting, taxation, and advertise and market our business.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I am currently in the process of creating an ecommerce website, it has shown me how ignorant I was about IT (and how fundamental it is to modern business). I am keen to learn more through this course, if not to sound less ignorant, to be more self-sufficient with managing this side of business.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I arrived at RMIT because it offered the specific degree I was after, my key interest is business, specifically the financial planning aspect (of life & business). Other universities offer similar commerce, accounting, finance, and business degrees, however not with the financial planning angle.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I only have 6 subjects left to complete my degree, I have learnt so much thus far and expect to expand my knowledge of financial and accounting compliance, wealth creation and management, and of course IT!</p.l>
							   <br> 
								 <h2 style="color:powderblue;">IT Experience</h2>
							   
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I am currently completing a business degree, analysing business to improve efficiency and profitability is what I am passionate about.</p.l> 
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I have worked in senior business roles for over a decade, I have experience managing teams, liaising with all levels of business support and management, improving business procedures and profitability and as mentioned above, I am currently in the last stages of completing a business degree (majoring in financially planning), which will solidify and streamline my business experience. I certainly could expand my knowledge in IT (which at present is reasonably basic), it is an area where I have previously relied on expert team members and departments to support me. I am hoping this unit in addition to further hands on experience, especially in the technical side of IT will improve my competency and eligibility for employment positions such as this.</p.l>

							   Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
   
							   Why do we use it?
							   It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
							   
							   
							   Where does it come from?
							   Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
							   
							   The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
							   
							   Where can I get some?
							   There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the

<p.l>Our team has taken various personality tests to help indicate how we will function together .

					<p.l>A Myers-Briggs test by 16 Personalities reveals that we have a Protagonist, an Architect, a Logician, a Virtuoso and two Mediators. 
					With this information, we can speculate on how the group may function as the project unfolds. <br><br>

				The Protagonist would take a leadership and organisation role, especially in the initial formation of the group. 
				The Architect and Logician may come up with the initial blueprints of the idea, with the Virtuoso also having significant input.<br> <br>

					Off of the cusp, abstract ideas will often be contributed by the mediators and the Virtuoso, as well as other members of the team. 
					The mediators and the protagonist will also be available to help the Architect, Logician and Virtuoso in communicating their ideas effectively with the group. <br><br>

					The team has also individually taken a combination of learning styles tests, which has shown that we have a broad mix of learning preferences. 
					The groups balance of auditory, visual, kinaesthetic and other learning styles will give us a healthy range of ideas and problem solving techniques to utilise from. <br><br>

						Finally, a big 5 test reveals that our team is quite mixed in makeup. Most members are at partially extroverted, however some are not. 
						This will mean that our team must be conscious of being inclusive with sharing input, and asking everybody for their opinions.  
					Most team members are generally quite agreeable, which will hopefully mean collaboration is easy for us during group meetings. 
						Most of our team members scored highly in openness/imagination and will be able to contribute creative ideas to our final project.<br><br>

					Overall our group has a strong mix of personalities and  learning methods which will allow for a diverse range of ideas and opinions. 
					Our hope is that this group dynamic is rich enough that everyone will have had a strong role to play in the overall project.

				<h1>Clouds, Services and Servers</h1>

						   <h2>What does it do?</h2>
						 <p.l>Cloud computing has been around for 20 years or so, it is an operational technology used for a plethora of purposes.
						 Clouds are communal resources (computers, applications, storage systems and services) where data is stored on another computer. Clouding computing is essentially outsourcing or centralising servers to facilitate access from anywhere and eliminating restrictions to a location, for example, a cloud host for a website allows everyone in the world to access the website from any device.
						Cloud computing also offers additional security features and provides for automatic maintenance and updates, generated remotely, and uploaded to your devices upon authorisation.
						   <h2>What can be done now?</h2>
						 Today there are three main types of cloud computing, Public, Private and Hybrid:
						  Public clouds are owned and managed by a cloud provider, who delivers services to a customer via an online account. All hardware, software and infrastructure is managed by a third-party.
						  Private cloud services are wholly owned and utilised by an organisation, the hardware can either be located onsite or offsite (supplied by a third-party host). The services and infrastructure are managed on an exclusive network.
						   Hybrid clouds are a combination of both private and public clouds, where data and applications are pooled between both clouds. Its offers flexibility and utilises existing infrastructure, security, and compliance.
						   There are also three main types of cloud services:>
						   Software as a Service, aka SaaS, is a service which delivers software applications over the internet. The software provider hosts, manages, and maintains the application and all underlying infrastructure. It is generally hired on a subscription basis and connected via an account over the internet.
						   Platform as a Service, aka PaaS, provides a platform for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. The user, usually a developer, pays for the hired use of the infrastructure, storage, network, and database to develop.
						   Infrastructure as a Service, aka IaaS, is as basic as cloud computing goes, you rent infrastructure (servers, virtual machines, storage, networks, operating systems) from the provider and pay on demand.
						   <h2>What is likely to be done soon?</h2>
						   In the next few years, almost all computing will be done via cloud. Cloud computing is built for automation, so can merge with legacy, current and new technologies to create an efficient, dynamic system.
						   A future focus on better cohesion with legacy systems will allow businesses with complex and ridged operating structures to transfer to a cloud-based operating system more easily.
						   Micro data centres are gaining traction, these compact units are located close to devices (which requires less bandwidth), where they perform certain tasks previously performed by large data centres.
						   Microsegmentation is an emerging software method used for data security, it creates an isolated ‘secure zone’ in a data centre, minimising the breadth and impact of a security breach.
						   With the increased need for data comes the increased need to deliver data faster, Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) is a storage protocol which accelerates the transfer of information between systems, drastically enhancing data relocation.

					   <div class="col-sm-12">
						   <p><h2>What does it do?</h2>  

						   <br><h3>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h3>  

Blockchain technology was originally described in 1991 by a group of researchers. Its original purpose was to time stamp digital documents so it would not be possible to backdate or tamper with them. This was, for the most part, an unused technology until 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto adapted it to create the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the first and most popular Cryptocurrency but there are over 1,500 different kinds of Cryptocurrencies now. Blockchain is a Technology that allows us to have distributed, decentralized currency like Bitcoin and Ether. A Blockchain is essentially a ledger that records information in blocks. The blocks store 3 different types of information to create a profile for the currency stored.  

Information about the transaction, for example, the date time and amount 

Information about who is involved in the transaction  

Information that distinguishes them from other blocks, these are called hashes.  

Each block has a profile called a hash. A hash is a way to identify exactly what the block is, like a fingerprint. Changing something inside the block will make the hash change. Aswell as their current hash, blocks store the hash of the previous block, thus creating a chain. (How does a blockchain work - Simply Explained, 2020) 

 

<br><h2>What can be done now?</h2>  

As Blockchain Technology evolves and becomes more versatile it is being used in more areas and projects outside Cryptocurrencies. For a system to have currency it must be extremely secure. This has naturally made Blockchain technology a hub for applications that need to hold and transfer secure files. Applications like Chronicled and CoinDesk rely on the Security that Blockchain presents to keep their information safe. Chronicled has its own Blockchain Technology that is uses to send data.  This is used to send Legal Documents, Supply chain and IOT tracking forms. CoinDesk is a platform that also uses blockchain, but for a different reason. CoinDesk was used by the United Nation World Food Program to give recourses to thousands of Syrian Refugee’s using Cryptocurrency Vouchers to purchase Olive oil, seeds and lentils. These are just 2 examples of how we can use this Technology to propel the world forward. (4 Blockchain Uses Besides Cryptocurrency | Venafi, 2020)  

						   <br><h3>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h3>  

In an interview we did for another segment of this assignment we interviewed a Software Engineer that is currently working on remodeling the entire back-end system of the ASX. They are currently testing and creating new segments of the CHESS back end operating system of the ASX. The Software Engineer stated that the implementation of a Blockchain system is being used to add an extra level of security with the ability to track and pinpoint transfers and purchases in a millisecond. This technology is going to continue to be implemented in our Financial systems as our governments catch up the forefront of our Technological abilities. It is likely that The Australian banks will start to change their tone on Blockchain systems and Cryptocurrency as it is being implemented into our Government Financial systems and their already existing infrastructure.  

What technological or other developments make this possible?  

 As Cryptocurrencies have only come to the forefront of popularity in the last decade, people often assume that the blockchain technology that houses it was created alongside it. The developments that allow large companies to use smart languages to create their own Blockchains started in 1991. Blockchain is known as a more recent technological development but must remember that blockchain isn't a software it’s a system, a system that has been under development for 29 years. Bitcoin may be the most popular Cryptocurrency, but it wasn’t the first. In 1998 Nick Szabo started work on ‘Bit Gold’ a digital currency. Bitcoin wasn’t created for another 10 years in 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto released a paper stating the model of the Cryptocurrency Blockchain. The actual BTC digital currency was created 1 year later in 2009. (History of blockchain, 2020) 

 

 

<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2><br>  

						   <h3>What is the potential impact of this development?</h3> 

Blockchain Technology itself has changed the IT World because of the ability to store and transfer data securely without a middleman. Along with this Technology, Blockchain brought along Cryptocurrencies with it. The Commonwealth Bank states that it does not allow the purchases of cryptocurrencies through their account because of volatility. It is likely that this is not the only because of its volatility but because of the likely impact of a system like Blockchain that doesn’t need 3rd parties like banks, brokers or other financial institutions to help the process along the way. This cuts out a huge part of our financial industry. (CBA blocks credit card purchases of virtual currencies, 2020) 

The impact will likely be like a lot of the other automation changes that affect the finance industry. As systems get automated, humans who work in those systems lose their jobs.  

<br><h3>What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how?</h3>   

The people who would be the most affected would be businesses and the individuals who are either developing the new technology or being replaced by it. Businesses will be forced change their systems to integrate with the ever-changing world of Blockchain ledgers and their advanced security. With competitor’s moving onto smart languages and creating their own blockchains, businesses will have to educate, specialize and evolve to keep up with their respective industries.  
 

<br><h3>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h3> 

We are likely to see many people lose their jobs through automation and the addition of things like Blockchain that cut our potential parties from a financial interaction. The finance industry has been and will continue to adapt to the changes in the Technology. With the changing landscape of the industry comes the need for specialist positions for people who handle automation. For example, if a bank has to fire 50 of their teller staff because of the implementation of a blockchain system that replaces most of their work, they will most likely have to hire specialists to build the system out of a secure smart language. This people will need to maintain and build the blockchain and language as it is now an integral part the business model. 

 

 

<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>   

<br><h3>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h3>   

The explosion of bitcoin and all 1’500 other cryptocurrencies have garnered a lot of attention. This development on the financial side, along with blockchain technology has naturally started to replace some of the less secure versions of the technology. People are starting to purchase more cryptocurrency because of the safety and security that the Blockchain brings.  

Larger companies and government sectors have started replacing their systems with Blockchain. You can see has slowly creeped into a lot of other sectors. Law firms apply the use of a blockchain system for safe and secure transfer of Smart Documents.  

I think that blockchain, not cryptocurrencies, are the technology of the two that has/will affect the landscape of the world to more significance.   

<br><h3>What will be different for you?</h3>   

Cryptocurrencies were almost taboo when I first heard about them in 2015. As Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrencies get more integrated into everyday society it is likely that the Australian banks will be more open to purchasing Cryptocurrencies through there interface instead of having to transfer it to a 3rd party like PayPal. For me, this will streamline to purchasing process of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or XRP.  

<br><h3>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h3>  

My libertarian or more financially savvy friends will be delighted to the development of these technologies whereas the other, larger, percentage of my family and friends will have no idea that their entire amazon order is processed by one of the most advanced Blockchains on earth.  </p>

						<p>The following is a table of the group members ideal jobs from assignment 1.  
						We have combined the skills required from the job listings and external sites with burning glass data provided by RMIT. </p> <br>

						   <h2><p> Has my opinion changed and why? </h2>
 

<h6>Imogen Leaver: Business Analyst </h6>
 

My ideal job is considered a hybrid skill set, combining general IT skills with finance, and accounting specific skills. Looking at the Burning Glass data provided, it shows little demand for business analytics, however, with a broader search, I can see great demand for hybrid jobs, which combine ‘traditional’ job sets with IT, data science and analytics. Burning Glass data shows over 1.7 million job advertisements specifying data science skills in 2018 and 617,300 total openings for jobs such as financial analysts and data scientists, so I am confident there is growing demand for my ideal job as a Business Analyst.

 

<h6>Henry Robinson: Front end developer. </h6>


After considering the Burning glass data, I am still very happy with my ideal job. Front end development roles are placed 6th in both occupation and job title jobs data. Specifically, there were 5,990 listings in the occupation listings, which makes me feel very optimistic. The biggest challenge for me will be developing the technical skillset required, as I am very new to coding in general. It is very comforting for me to see that there is high demand, as it only furthers my motivations to attain this kind of work. It’s also worth noting that JAVAscript is the 2nd most required IT skill in the listings, which means there may also be room for crossover into other roles.

 

<h6>Andrew Rijs: PHP Developer </h6>

 

Whilst the job listing I pursued is relatively unpopular (24th, 277 Listings), several of the essential skills required are the most common technical skills job advertisements ask for (with SQL in first and JavaScript in second). In addition to these technical skills, the generic skill required (good problem solving) is the second most required attribute in the burning glass analysis. This gives me confidence that if I choose to gain a skillset in these areas, I will be able to find work that fits closely to my initial ideal job. Having had a brief introduction to these languages in previous studies has further informed my decision that this is a path I'd like to go down. 

 

 

<h6>Max Torti: Data centre technician. </h6>

 

 

Throughout the span of these last few weeks I have been considering my ideal job, I still thoroughly enjoy the idea of working as a data centre technician. The skills needed fit my interests, such as hardware repair, IT computer networking and troubleshooting skills. I have always loved making computers, troubleshooting them and seeing what I can tweak to further improve them (overclocking), I am also eager to learn more about the fields of networks and cybersecurity. Data centre technicians are required to be good with communicating with people, they are expected to give support and educate clients. With all of this in mind I feel that the role of data center technician fits nicely. 

However, after reviewing the burning glass data I have some worries. Burning glass explains data centre technicians as not working a regular 9-5 job, I have no problem with this as of right now, however my opinion might change as life goes on. With this mystery surrounding hours I begin to worry about job security and income. 

 

<h6>Benjamin Christy: Senior network engineer. </h6>
 

After looking at the burning glass data I still consider being a network engineer as my ideal job. 

There are currently 2,478 active job listings and the 5-year projected job growth (according to seek.com.au) is 26.2%. The skills and qualifications for the position also overlap and open up other doors for several different fields in the IT industry. This makes me feel very confident with my career choice and gives me the ability to move around in the industry if I feel like I need to do so. 
 

<h6>Liam O'Dell: Cyber Security Specialist </h6>

After looking into the various types of employment in cyber security I would consider Cyber Security Specialist or a similar position my ideal job. As different companies advertise positions with different titles it is hard to compare the positions. It is the industry that entices me so other related positions like Cyber Security Analyst and Cyber Security Engineer also are very attractive options in the future. Out the first 5 active job listings on Seek, all 5 of them list interpersonal or communication skills as the most in demand skill for this job. This gives me confidence that I can continue to work towards this position as the burning glass data suggests that this the top In Demand baseline skill and I work very diligently on having great interpersonal and communication skills. I have always known that my ideal job would be require high levels of communication and think that it is one of my strong suits.
