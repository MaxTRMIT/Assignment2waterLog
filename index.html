						 <h1>Team Profile</h1>
						   <p>Our team has taken various personality tests to help indicate how we may function.

<p>A Myers-Briggs test by 16 Personalities reveals that we have a Protagonist, an Architect, a Logician, a Virtuoso and two Mediators. 
With this information, we can speculate on how the group may function as the project unfolds.</p>

<p>The Protagonist would take a leadership and organisation role, especially in the initial formation of the group. 
The Architect and Logician may come up with the initial blueprints of the idea, with the Virtuoso also having significant input. </p>

<p>Off of the cusp, abstract ideas will often be contributed by the mediators and the Virtuoso, as well as other members of the team. 
The mediators and the protagonist will also be available to help the Architect, Logician and Virtuoso in communicating their ideas effectively with the group. </p>

<p>The team has also individually taken a combination of learning styles tests, which has shown that we have a broad mix of learning preferences. 
The groups balance of auditory, visual, kinaesthetic and other learning styles will give us a healthy range of ideas and problem solving techniques to utilise from. </p>

<p>Finally, a big 5 test reveals that our team is quite mixed in makeup. Most members are at partially extroverted, however some are not. 
This will mean that our team must be conscious of being inclusive with sharing input, and asking everybody for their opinions.  
Most team members are generally quite agreeable, which will hopefully mean collaboration is easy for us during group meetings. 
	Most of our team members scored highly in openness/imagination and will be able to contribute creative ideas to our final project.</p> 

<p>Overall our group has a strong mix of personalities and  learning methods which will allow for a diverse range of ideas and opinions. 
Our hope is that this group dynamic is rich enough that everyone will have had a strong role to play in the overall project. </p>

							   S3879123 
							   <br>
							   I was born in rural NSW and moved to Sydney when I was 18 years old. I am currently employed as a Coach and Administrative Officer at a Martial Arts Academy on Sydney’s North Shore. I graduated from South Grafton High School in 2013. I am currently enrolled in an IT degree at RMIT university and am studying via Open University. As well as work and education I compete in Muay Thai Kickboxing, Submission Grappling and Folkstyle Wrestling Competitions at both regional and state levels.<br>
							   
							   From making video games to website and app design, I have been tinkering with aspects of IT since my family got its 1st computer in 2004. Now as an adult I have started this degree to learn more about technology. The parts of Information Technology that interest me are mainly cyber security, application design and sharing Technology with the world. I am passionate about making the world a better place through the tools that Information Technology supplies us.

							   <h2 style="color:powderblue;">About Me</h2>   
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">RMIT Student Number: s3667801.</p.l>
								 <p.l style="font-family:courier;">My name is Imogen Leaver, I am Australian born, of English, Irish and Scottish decent.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I only speak English, however my sister-in-law is half Peruvian, and is determined to teach me Spanish.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I am currently completing a Bachelor of Business – Financial Planning, having gained recognition of prior learning from a Diploma in Business.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I love riding my bike, going to the beach, travelling (on hold thanks to COVID), my family and considering the environment.</p.l>
							   <br>
							   
								<h2 style="color:powderblue;">Interest in IT</h2>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">This IT unit is a core subject in my business degree, running two business, I completely appreciate why IT is essential to understanding and learning about business. It is the platform on which we communicate, manage eCommerce, accounting, taxation, and advertise and market our business.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I am currently in the process of creating an ecommerce website, it has shown me how ignorant I was about IT (and how fundamental it is to modern business). I am keen to learn more through this course, if not to sound less ignorant, to be more self-sufficient with managing this side of business.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I arrived at RMIT because it offered the specific degree I was after, my key interest is business, specifically the financial planning aspect (of life & business). Other universities offer similar commerce, accounting, finance, and business degrees, however not with the financial planning angle I was after.</p.l>
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I only have 6 subjects left to complete my degree, I have learnt so much thus far and expect to expand my knowledge of financial and accounting compliance, wealth creation and management, and of course IT!</p.l>
							   <br> 
								 <h2 style="color:powderblue;">IT Experience</h2>
							   
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I am currently completing a business degree, analysing business to improve efficiency and profitability is what I am passionate about.  To strategise and implement change in a local council, bettering the lives of the residents in that municipality (especially an area with lower socio-economic status) would be a passion job for me.</p.l> 
							   <p.l style="font-family:courier;">I have worked in senior business roles for over a decade, I have experience managing teams, liaising with all levels of business support and management, improving business procedures and profitability and as mentioned above, I am currently in the last stages of completing a business degree (majoring in financially planning), which will solidify and streamline my business experience. I certainly could expand my knowledge in IT (which at present is reasonably basic), it is an area where I have previously relied on expert team members and departments to support me. I am hoping this unit in addition to further hands on experience, especially in the technical side of IT will improve my competency and eligibility for employment positions such as this.</p.l>

							   Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
   
							   Why do we use it?
							   It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
							   
							   
							   Where does it come from?
							   Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
							   
							   The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
							   
							   Where can I get some?
							   There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.

						 <h1>Clouds, Services and Servers</h1>
						   
					   </div>

						<div class="col-sm-12">
						   <h2>What does it do?</h2>
						 <p>Cloud computing has been around for 20 years or so, it is an operational technology used for a plethora of purposes.</p>
						 <p>Clouds are communal resources (computers, applications, storage systems and services) where data is stored on another computer. Clouding computing is essentially outsourcing or centralising servers to facilitate access from anywhere and eliminating restrictions to a location, for example, a cloud host for a website allows everyone in the world to access the website from any device.</p>
						 <p>Cloud computing also offers additional security features and provides for automatic maintenance and updates, generated remotely, and uploaded to your devices upon authorisation.</p>
						   <h2>What can be done now?</h2>
						   <p>Today there are three main types of cloud computing, Public, Private and Hybrid:</p>
						   <p>Public clouds are owned and managed by a cloud provider, who delivers services to a customer via an online account. All hardware, software and infrastructure is managed by a third-party.</p>
						   <p>Private cloud services are wholly owned and utilised by an organisation, the hardware can either be located onsite or offsite (supplied by a third-party host). The services and infrastructure are managed on an exclusive network.</p>
						   <p>Hybrid clouds are a combination of both private and public clouds, where data and applications are pooled between both clouds. Its offers flexibility and utilises existing infrastructure, security, and compliance.</p>
						   <p>There are also three main types of cloud services:</p>
						   <p>Software as a Service, aka SaaS, is a service which delivers software applications over the internet. The software provider hosts, manages, and maintains the application and all underlying infrastructure. It is generally hired on a subscription basis and connected via an account over the internet.</p>
						   <p>Platform as a Service, aka PaaS, provides a platform for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. The user, usually a developer, pays for the hired use of the infrastructure, storage, network, and database to develop.</p>
						   <p>Infrastructure as a Service, aka IaaS, is as basic as cloud computing goes, you rent infrastructure (servers, virtual machines, storage, networks, operating systems) from the provider and pay on demand.</p>
						   <h2>What is likely to be done soon?</h2>
						   <p>In the next few years, almost all computing will be done via cloud. Cloud computing is built for automation, so can merge with legacy, current and new technologies to create an efficient, dynamic system.</p>
						   <p>A future focus on better cohesion with legacy systems will allow businesses with complex and ridged operating structures to transfer to a cloud-based operating system more easily.</p>
						   <p>Micro data centres are gaining traction, these compact units are located close to devices (which requires less bandwidth), where they perform certain tasks previously performed by large data centres.</p>
						   <p>Microsegmentation is an emerging software method used for data security, it creates an isolated ‘secure zone’ in a data centre, minimising the breadth and impact of a security breach.</p>
						   <p>With the increased need for data comes the increased need to deliver data faster, Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) is a storage protocol which accelerates the transfer of information between systems, drastically enhancing data relocation.</p>

						 <h1>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies.</h1>
					   </div>
					   <div class="col-sm-12">
						   <p><h2>What does it do?</h2>  

						   <br><h3>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h3>  

Blockchain technology was originally described in 1991 by a group of researchers. Its original purpose was to time stamp digital documents so it would not be possible to backdate or tamper with them. This was, for the most part, an unused technology until 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto adapted it to create the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the first and most popular Cryptocurrency but there are over 1,500 different kinds of Cryptocurrencies now. Blockchain is a Technology that allows us to have distributed, decentralized currency like Bitcoin and Ether. A Blockchain is essentially a ledger that records information in blocks. The blocks store 3 different types of information to create a profile for the currency stored.  

Information about the transaction, for example, the date time and amount 

Information about who is involved in the transaction  

Information that distinguishes them from other blocks, these are called hashes.  

Each block has a profile called a hash. A hash is a way to identify exactly what the block is, like a fingerprint. Changing something inside the block will make the hash change. Aswell as their current hash, blocks store the hash of the previous block, thus creating a chain. (How does a blockchain work - Simply Explained, 2020) 

 

<br><h2>What can be done now?</h2>  

As Blockchain Technology evolves and becomes more versatile it is being used in more areas and projects outside Cryptocurrencies. For a system to have currency it must be extremely secure. This has naturally made Blockchain technology a hub for applications that need to hold and transfer secure files. Applications like Chronicled and CoinDesk rely on the Security that Blockchain presents to keep their information safe. Chronicled has its own Blockchain Technology that is uses to send data.  This is used to send Legal Documents, Supply chain and IOT tracking forms. CoinDesk is a platform that also uses blockchain, but for a different reason. CoinDesk was used by the United Nation World Food Program to give recourses to thousands of Syrian Refugee’s using Cryptocurrency Vouchers to purchase Olive oil, seeds and lentils. These are just 2 examples of how we can use this Technology to propel the world forward. (4 Blockchain Uses Besides Cryptocurrency | Venafi, 2020)  

						   <br><h3>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h3>  

In an interview we did for another segment of this assignment we interviewed a Software Engineer that is currently working on remodeling the entire back-end system of the ASX. They are currently testing and creating new segments of the CHESS back end operating system of the ASX. The Software Engineer stated that the implementation of a Blockchain system is being used to add an extra level of security with the ability to track and pinpoint transfers and purchases in a millisecond. This technology is going to continue to be implemented in our Financial systems as our governments catch up the forefront of our Technological abilities. It is likely that The Australian banks will start to change their tone on Blockchain systems and Cryptocurrency as it is being implemented into our Government Financial systems and their already existing infrastructure.  

What technological or other developments make this possible?  

 As Cryptocurrencies have only come to the forefront of popularity in the last decade, people often assume that the blockchain technology that houses it was created alongside it. The developments that allow large companies to use smart languages to create their own Blockchains started in 1991. Blockchain is known as a more recent technological development but must remember that blockchain isn't a software it’s a system, a system that has been under development for 29 years. Bitcoin may be the most popular Cryptocurrency, but it wasn’t the first. In 1998 Nick Szabo started work on ‘Bit Gold’ a digital currency. Bitcoin wasn’t created for another 10 years in 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto released a paper stating the model of the Cryptocurrency Blockchain. The actual BTC digital currency was created 1 year later in 2009. (History of blockchain, 2020) 

 

 

<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2><br>  

						   <h3>What is the potential impact of this development?</h3> 

Blockchain Technology itself has changed the IT World because of the ability to store and transfer data securely without a middleman. Along with this Technology, Blockchain brought along Cryptocurrencies with it. The Commonwealth Bank states that it does not allow the purchases of cryptocurrencies through their account because of volatility. It is likely that this is not the only because of its volatility but because of the likely impact of a system like Blockchain that doesn’t need 3rd parties like banks, brokers or other financial institutions to help the process along the way. This cuts out a huge part of our financial industry. (CBA blocks credit card purchases of virtual currencies, 2020) 

The impact will likely be like a lot of the other automation changes that affect the finance industry. As systems get automated, humans who work in those systems lose their jobs.  

<br><h3>What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how?</h3>   

The people who would be the most affected would be businesses and the individuals who are either developing the new technology or being replaced by it. Businesses will be forced change their systems to integrate with the ever-changing world of Blockchain ledgers and their advanced security. With competitor’s moving onto smart languages and creating their own blockchains, businesses will have to educate, specialize and evolve to keep up with their respective industries.  
 

<br><h3>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h3> 

We are likely to see many people lose their jobs through automation and the addition of things like Blockchain that cut our potential parties from a financial interaction. The finance industry has been and will continue to adapt to the changes in the Technology. With the changing landscape of the industry comes the need for specialist positions for people who handle automation. For example, if a bank has to fire 50 of their teller staff because of the implementation of a blockchain system that replaces most of their work, they will most likely have to hire specialists to build the system out of a secure smart language. This people will need to maintain and build the blockchain and language as it is now an integral part the business model. 

 

 

<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>   

<br><h3>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h3>   

The explosion of bitcoin and all 1’500 other cryptocurrencies have garnered a lot of attention. This development on the financial side, along with blockchain technology has naturally started to replace some of the less secure versions of the technology. People are starting to purchase more cryptocurrency because of the safety and security that the Blockchain brings.  

Larger companies and government sectors have started replacing their systems with Blockchain. You can see has slowly creeped into a lot of other sectors. Law firms apply the use of a blockchain system for safe and secure transfer of Smart Documents.  

I think that blockchain, not cryptocurrencies, are the technology of the two that has/will affect the landscape of the world to more significance.   

<br><h3>What will be different for you?</h3>   

Cryptocurrencies were almost taboo when I first heard about them in 2015. As Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrencies get more integrated into everyday society it is likely that the Australian banks will be more open to purchasing Cryptocurrencies through there interface instead of having to transfer it to a 3rd party like PayPal. For me, this will streamline to purchasing process of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or XRP.  

<br><h3>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h3>  

My libertarian or more financially savvy friends will be delighted to the development of these technologies whereas the other, larger, percentage of my family and friends will have no idea that their entire amazon order is processed by one of the most advanced Blockchains on earth.  </p>

							<h1>Professional Interview</h1>
						  </div>
						  <div class="col-sm-12">
							<p>The interview that we conducted was with an IT professional that works with both a independent software contractor and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Below you will find a summary of the answers given by our Interviewed IT Professional. Due to contract issues we are unable to use the recording, but I have attached the transcript in the report attached.  

 

							  <h2>1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h2>

Most of my work is in the financial markets. Previously I worked in research roles using programming to research different concepts in the stock market. My current role is technically called product owner with a software development company that is replacing the ASX backend clearance and settlement system which is basically a big database.<br>

It's quite a well-known system it's called chess. The last time it was replaced was 30 years ago. We are using a Distributed ledger like a block chain solution. The company I work for has their own smart contracting language that pairs the buyers and the sellers together. The role that I'm in is product owner.<br>

This is that under the agile model of software development. Where you have short term targets and sprints in contrast to a waterfall model where you’ll be planning for months or even years. Because there is a big infrastructure, we must split everything into like 2-week intervals. My role is to communicate from the customer, The ASX, and our team of software engineers and testing for any problems that may come up under the ASX Security guidelines.<br>

<br><h2>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h2>

I’ve always been in financial markets. Previously as a big broker dealer for Charles Shaub. Most of my work is about financial markets. Either stocks or the backend plumbing of how it works. ITs great being multi-industry because I have so much room to work with. 

<br><h2>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h2>

In Previous roles I've done a lot of managerial stuff, current role is slightly different as instead of managing people our professional is a managing a product.  

A Large portion of work is writing tests to make sure that everything in the project is by ASX standards of development and security.  

<br><h2>4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</h2>
 

I'm the bridge between the IT guys and the finance guys so they’re is a big range of personality types that I've got to work with. 

<br><h2>5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h2>

Because of the nature of the project we have some of the best developers from around Australia for the languages that we are using. We have a lot of smart and quirky people. Overall, everyone is quite professional and nice on the IT side of things. Everyone on the ASX side is a little more integrated into suit culture but also still very nice people. As I must be the bridge between the finance guys and the IT guys it helps to be friends with them all to understand where they are coming from. 

<br><h2>6. What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h2>

There can be challenges with any client, especially such a bug project like this, there are times where we don’t agree on what should be done. In that case we must negotiate to get the client what they want while still doing it in a safe, efficient and sustainable way.  

<br><h2>7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h2> 

When I started it was learning how to communicate with my coworkers effectively and get like settled in but now the most time would be to write those tests that verify that we are doing the right thing, something that meets the requirements. A lot of it is managing the workload of others but currently in the project it's a lot of tests. 

<br><h2>8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h2>

I made a very big change to get into this role, as I hadn't done any of the background or plumbing stuff yet. I didn’t have much exposure to all the little transfers and terms that the ASX has for things. Smart contacts and the new test language were also a big struggle to learn. It took me about 6 months to feel like I was adding value to the team as there was just so much to understand when I started. 

<br><h2>9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h2>

I don’t know that seems like a vague one so I'll try put it as best as I can. Using the latest technology to improve technologies, to streamline and to make things easier and more efficient for everyone. </div>
